DNA Structure:\n   - DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid\n   - It's a double-helix structure, like a twisted ladder\n   - The \"sides\" of the ladder are made of sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate groups\n   - The \"rungs\" are made of complementary base pairs: Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T), and Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G)\n\n2. Genes:\n   - Genes are segments of DNA that code for specific proteins\n   - They contain the instructions for building and maintaining an organism\n\n3. Chromosomes:\n   - DNA is organized into structures called chromosomes\n   - Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes\n\n4. DNA Replication:\n   - The process by which DNA makes a copy of itself\n   - Essential for cell division and passing genetic information to offspring\n\n5. Gene Expression:\n   - Transcription: DNA is used as a template to create RNA\n   - Translation: RNA is used to create proteins\n\n6. Mutations:\n   - Changes in DNA sequence\n   - Can be harmful, beneficial, or neutral\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these points? Or do you have any questions about these DNA basics?"
